Generating spoooooooky GIFs

In this assignment, we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice. 

## Getting Started

**Spooky Giphy**

Instructions:

Enter a term into the search box.
As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear below.
If you are not sure of a term to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

The theme is SPOOOOOKY to inspire you to enter a related term, but feel free to search any items that is of interest to you.
